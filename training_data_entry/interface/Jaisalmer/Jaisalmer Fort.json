The fort is definitely the landmark to visit that might be recognised from one of latest Batmans movies. Yet, despite of its beauty the place is more and more ran-down because of the locals that live there and don't really appreciate what they have. As a tourist I did not do any paid trips nor anything like this. The fort is opened and you can freely wander around which is really amazing to do. But as some of the reviews mentioned local community needs to become aware of this monument and take more care of it. Another thing that one might be bothered by are stranded dogs, which are everywhere and even if during the day they chill in the shade during the nighttime they attack passers by and are quite a bother.

This can be quite annoying, but it's normal to this place, as they live from tourists 6 months a year, when the season lasts. They will call you to come into their shop \"Just to have a look\" and then be very pushy to sell you something putting products in your hands. Remember that haggling is an \"art\" in India / I am not good at it at all /, so don't go for the first thing you see nor for the first price you hear.

Currently, its home to many locals who cant buy into the property, but can continue to live in it due to a legacy being carried forward for  many years. The fort houses the highly eclectic Killa Bhavan hotel, which is considered by Harpers review to be amongst the150 most romantic places on earth. Apart from the aforementioned, the fort has an ancient Jain temple as well which is a must see. The various gallis (narrow streets) of the fort allows you to relive the ancient yore. The architecture is organic at its best and makes for amazing photography, with ample sunlight creating a rich array of textures on its various walls and surfaces. This is indeed a place to bask within Jaisalmer, where travellers will be able to whisk the air of years gone by, as if it was yesterday. Raise a toast to India's rich cultural heritage.

But a little walk inside shows the Jaisalmer fort that stands tall as evidence of ancient times. It's in good condition and well-maintained. While the fort looks similar to most other forts in Rajasthan but history separates each fort from the other. And most importantly the heritage of the King who reigned back then. One of the best parts of the Jaisalmer fort is that once  you reach the top of the fort which is more like a terrace (if compared to urban times) then one gets a bird's eye view of the whole of Jaisalmer. It's beautiful!!! You can also buy camel leather bags and other paraphernalia within the fort which is available at competitive prices.

They need to move out the shops and vendors to parts of the city which is quite well laid out and clean. There are supposed to be 300 original inhabitants who have a right to live there but it's now so crowded I think a time will come when they will have to close it down. The fort itself is well preserved and the view from the top is great. The most impressive and CLEAN building is the Jain temple which is a must see.Very useful to get a guide to show you around the fort and the impressive Havelis in the city.

It seems like there is nothing left but desert and then there arises a magnificent city that was part of the silk route to china.  The havalis (houses with stores) are very early and many have marvellous paintings.  The stores sell everything from silk, to silver all hand made into beautiful objects of art.  Most of the top goods are sold to the designers in Paris.  It is a city of narrow streets with cows wandering in the aisles and street vendors doing their best to sell goods.  If you are not interested in purchasing please just hold up your hand and say a firm' No Thankyou'.  Don't get into a discussion or make rude remarks as everyone is just trying to make a living.  This applies to the whole of India.  I have toured the fort and purchased wonderful handmade bedspreads and jackets and silver pieces such as thimbles.  Bhawani can help with any purchase and you will enjoy them greatly once you get home.  This is one of my favourite cities to explore as great history and still many adventures to be enjoyed.

However, credit is due to the administration where they have been able to maintain the sanctity of the place; sort of a balance between both visitors and residents. You should have absolutely no problem with plenty of options around in case you feel hungry but my impression is that the entire approach and the meandering pathways within the castle are not buggy/stroller friendly.

The Part/Palace exists and seems very small from outside. The pieces which are on display makes one wonder whether this really was a palace at one time, or is it now turned into a small museum. Honestly, did not find anything in there which was impressive. The place is under control of the current royal heir and one can see that the place is not well kept.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d324658-r660670520-Jaisalmer_Fort-Jaisalmer_Jaisalmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Jaisalmer Fort", "rating": 5.0, "title": "The Marrakech of India !
