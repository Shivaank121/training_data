But, the beautiful yellow sandstone cenotaphs - called \"chhatris\" - are empty tombs, honoring the Maharawals of Jaisalmer, their wives, other royal family members and war heroes - and were built while they were alive and in good spirits. This tradition was discontinued not very long ago, in 1947, when, according to a local legend, a prince died of a mysterious disease while his \"chhatris\" was being built. This was considered as a very bad omen leading to the end of this 200 year old tradition. Amazing legends of the \"Golden City\" of Jaisalmer ...
