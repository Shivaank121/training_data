Not only is it a spatially unusual building but the current run-down state of it means you can actually see layers of construction - not an unusal condition for India but here I found it really legible. Also it's quirky - the top floor with it's central cradle, remnants of mirrored decorative ceilings and walls (in a room where I was told a dancer would perform!?), tiny balconies around (they're not likely to fall down any time soon imo - they're just not cantilevering very far at all).... just look at photos of the outside - you will not find another building like this in Rajasthan and it's intimate scale and the explaination of it's ergonomics (the lack of headroom and dangerous, varying proportions of the stairs for example helped stop intruders) made it, for me, a captivating experience.
