The legends about the abandoned village are much more interesting than the ruins themselves. As our guide told us, on one single night in 1825, the whole population deserted the village probably due: 1) to stop Jaisalmer's State Minister from forcibly marrying a village girl (daughter of a prominent local leader); or 2) to scape from unfair taxes levied over the village by Jaisalmer's State Minister); or 3) to a severe water shortage. While leaving, they cursed Khuldara: no one would ever leave here again! As time passed, it went to ruins and remained inhabited.

It is situated around 18 Kms from Jaisalmer city. Paliwal Brahmins used to live in this village till 170 years ago. Theer are numerous stories about this village that how people left it and why it is considered haunted. Villagers abandoned this village as ruler of the area Diwan Salim Singh had tried to force marriage with a girl of the village and villagers did not agree rather they left village with a curse that this village will remain abandoned forever.
