This is one of the main garrison towns of the British colonial army. And coincidentally the town where very early settled  Anglican missionaries.  St. Mary church, in fact, was actually built by them for the needs of British garrison. With the cemetery, where are buried many soldiers and officers. I have not seen here something particularly noteworthy, the anglican culture of the decoration of burial places  is still noticeably below and more ascetic than the followers of other religions have. Although this church in Nasirabad, as they say (unofficially, of course), has allegedly a sliver from the cross of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d3696091-r498930404-St_Mary_s_Graveyard-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "St. Mary's Graveyard", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Stay away if you are sensitive...", "review": "It is situated just adjecent to the Nasirabad railway station.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d3696091-r627117392-St_Mary_s_Graveyard-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "St. Mary's Graveyard", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Visit", "review": "St. Mary's Graveyard is one of the oldest & most coveted places of visit in Ajmer.
