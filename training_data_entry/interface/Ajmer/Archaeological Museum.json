Interesting museum, though small. It's actually the part of the Government museum, and, as I understand it, not only of Ajmer but also of the entire Rajasthan state. Fccording to its intended profile here are exhibited ancient inscriptions, coins, artifacts from the excavations (including even from Mohenjo-Daro) and the richest section of sculpture, among which, however, are exhibits dated 6 or 7 centuries \u2013 like small figurines and black marble figure of the goddess Kali.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d4088461-r499305501-Archaeological_Museum-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Archaeological Museum", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Great...", "review": "One of the best museum I had ever visited.
