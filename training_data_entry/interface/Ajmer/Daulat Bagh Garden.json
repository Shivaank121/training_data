In that context, trees, flowers, gardens are really soothing however much they are not maintained.That is the case with Durga Bagh. The marble pavilons errected by mughals add enormous beauty to the bagh. British apparently had destroyed the beauty by putting up buildings here. Credit goes to the Indian government  for demolishing those concrete structures and  restoring the glory of Mughal Royal  Park. It has now been handed over to the general public. Evenings are pretty crowded  with people. They come here for strolling along the lake and sit under the marble pavilions. For a tourist, it is worthwhile to visit here for about one hour and take a rest while seeing the beauty. This is situated closer to the Nasian temple and Akbar's palace.
