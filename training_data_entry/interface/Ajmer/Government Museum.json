For it  is designated the former  Fort built and walled by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, including a double storied bastion enclosed by columns. However, some of the most revered artifacts \u2013 inscriptions, and books for foreign tourists, like me,  won't say much. But sculptures, and for them is reserved more space \u2013 literally and figuratively, cannot fail to impress. A good exposition of arms and armoury (including even artillery). Interesting, as always in India, is the section representing local crafts. It is regrettable that it is not as great as I would like. Presented here are also artifacts from the excavations, including even from Mohenjo Daro.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d3913096-r499122398-Government_Museum-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Government Museum", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Great...", "review": "It is just great to visit.
