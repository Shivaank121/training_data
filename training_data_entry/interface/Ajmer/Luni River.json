In fact, all great civilizations appeared in river valleys. For Rajasthan  Luni became such river. But now it is in many desert areas drying river and its flow is gaining ground only in the rainy season and mostly in the area of Jodhpur and beyond. It is believed that its source is near Ajmer in Pushkar valley, somewhere between Dantra and Bhanwta. However,  in Pushkar they showed me some brook near  \"Pushkar Lake Palace Hotel\" with  almost dried up stream and said that this is Luni river, only here it's called Sukri.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d4421762-r499306007-Luni_River-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Luni River", "rating": 2.0, "title": "Its a Dead water stream", "review": "I visited the place in May 2018 So I am not sure if its the summer which is causing the dry up or its by default like that.
