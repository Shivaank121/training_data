It is was built by Anaji Chauhan, the grandfather of Prithvi Raj Chauhan, in 1135 -1150 AD and is named after him. The catchments were built with the help of local populace. The Baradari or pavilions were built by Shahjahan in 1637 and Daulat Bagh Gardens by Jehangir. The lake is spread over 13 Kilometers. There is a Circuit house on a hill near the lake that used to be British Residency. There is an island in the center of the lake which is accessible by boat or water scooter. Boats and water scooters could be hired from the east side of the Dault Bagh. The lake gets dry every summar. The Rajasthan High Court has banned construction in the catchment areas of the lake basins. This is one of the beautiful lake in India. It's situated near the CHILLA of Khwaja Moinuddin CHishti (R.A) due to which this place is famous and it's also one of the the world heritage sites.

Many  visitors will agree that despite the amazing diversity in India, from the cleanliness point of view, many if not all locations in India are dusty and  full of heaps of garbage. So one needs to find a place that gives a bit of  solace under these conditions. From this perspective, in Ajmer, visiting the Ana sagar lake especially the  park where the marble pavilions  get some unpleasant feelings  of rubbish and dust off your mind. I visited the place in  a hot summer and it was definitely a get away for me. It is pretty crowded and to some extent not well maintained. But the marble pavilions erected by mughuls are fantastic. I think a visitor to Ajmer especially  foreigners need to have a look at it. Full credits to the Indian government for re establishing its former glory after British colonialists built several concrete structures in here. Indian government demolished all these buildings and the Mughul Bagh (garden) was re created  for the recreational activities  of the general public. It is a nice place to go and get your mind relaxed having strolled in the bagh by the side of the Ana sagar lake.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d2693853-r164039010-Ana_Sagar_Lake-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Ana Sagar Lake", "rating": 5.0, "title": "BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO ENJOY YOUR EVENING", "review": "It is a good place to be visited and for spending few hours at this historical lake, which is on the bank of BARADARI build by Mughal emperor some 350 years ago.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d2693853-r129201043-Ana_Sagar_Lake-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Ana Sagar Lake", "rating": 5.0, "title": "very beautiful place", "review": "This place is very beautiful,it feels very great to enjoy the scenes(specially in evening) of lake Anasagar.
