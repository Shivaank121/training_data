It's eight hours by road from Delhi so I think I should come here more often, but my last trip in August was only my fourth. I went on a Sunday afternoon which is a very good day and time to go to the Dargah to offer prayers. The last time I went was on a Friday afternoon and it was all too rushed due to the crowd presumably because it was Namaz time. So it was a relief to enter the Dargah on a Sunday when the crowd was more manageable. Moreover it allowed me to get more time in the two prayer areas which is precisely what I went there for. The other thing I liked compared to earlier visits was that we were allowed to click photographs and that was great. As for money, carry only what you need and leave your debit, credit cards behind if possible. I always love my visits to the Ajmer Dargah and this was no different.

One vendor' representative followed us for some distance and when he realized we are not going to buy anything from him said. OK then wait in the Que for 4 fours  Thankfully we did not have to wait so long, however the crowd management was so bad. Finally when we entered the inner sanctum, the crush was so intense that you almost suffocate. This is definitely not a good experience for woman to be crushed from all sides. All we wanted to do was stand peacefully and pray which we could not do. We were literally pushed out by the following crowd.. We could only breath properly after exiting the inner sanctum.

Spoilers ahead do not hire anyone who would want to escort you at the main gate. The visit can be done all alone you don't need any guide here. The place is very poorly managed, no trust or authority I guess. Be aware of anybody trying to help you or guide as that is not required. The only thing they would do is take to someone even before you could pray  and ask you to donate money which was something we didn't appreciate . Overall not so good experience of the place n people.  The local bodies could do a better job and organise things a bit here. A must visit though because of khwaja, despite all these things you could feel the power and serenity at the holy shrine.  Must visit at least once in lifetime.

The khadim made us buy a costly chaddar Rs. 1200 & then took us to a guy who was taking donations as per his wish & was rude when you stated your amount of donation. donate money yourselves to the needy.The person who takes your offerings inside the dargah asks for a minimum of Rs. 500 for offering your chaddar to the  khwaja & wishes bad if you dont payup. The dargah is very crowded & frequented with pickpockets. I lost my wallet. There were many more who had lost their wallets in the dargah. If you happen to visit the dargah do it yourselves. dont employ the servies of any middlemen. take flowers or anyother offering of your choice & dont get tricked in by any shopkeeper. dont carry wallets & mobiles, you will surely loose them. just carry minimum cash in your front pockets. be careful of your children, it is almost a stemped like situation inside the shrine. be careful & dont allow anyone to play up on your faith, beliefs & emotions.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g317096-d1059689-r239657739-Dargah_Shariff-Ajmer_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Dargah Shariff", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Tere dar per aaya hu", "review": "What a Dargah ?while visiting the place keep some time and don't carry cameras as they don't allow anything inside.

The pilgrims make rich offerings called 'nazrana' at the sacred spot where the saint has been entombed that include rose and jasmine flowers, sandalwood paste, perfumes and incense that put in to the fragrance that floats in the air inside the shrine. Cash offerings are also made. Also offered by devotees are the 'chaadar', 'ghilaph' and 'neema'. Outside the holy place of the Dargah, professional singers called 'qawwals' sit in groups and sing hymns in the praises of the saint in a characteristic high-pitched voice. Be careful inside -- pickpocketing has been known to occur, particularly in the entrance to the shrine where people are packed very close together.
