I remember a similar feeling I had in Agra as we drove the 40 minutes to the \"baby Taj\" (Itimad-ad-daulah. The same white marble rectangular form of the building without curves and equally elegant, graceful, though in vision  deceptively simple structure. But there's some amazing proportionality, some underlined nobility of shape, which is difficult to achieve and extremely rare.
