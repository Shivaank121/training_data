At the end the view of the falls is rewarding and in day hour one can swim in the lake below the falls. The guide told the depth of the lake is of 40 ft and there is a cave down the water; so lot of accidents happen every year as people take risks considering the smaller nature of the falls and the lake. Life jackets are available on hire. Please wear good walking shoes and carry drinking water and some snacks as there is no arrangements and you will feel hungry after the trek and swim.
