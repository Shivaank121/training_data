I frankly had no clue that Uttarakhand even grew tea. And coming from Bengal, the home of Darjeeling Tea, a certain snobbishness about all tea is part of my mental makeup. But all that was about to change.The tea garden is quite beautiful and well maintained though not very large. It was obvious that the State cared for this industry. There is a shop attached to the garden, and we they had 2 varieties, priced at a modest Rs. 400 and Rs. 600 per kg. We bought 250 gm of the higher priced one, and the lady at the shop very humbly told us that it requires 3-5 mins brewing, like its Darjeeling originals and may not be able to support addition of milk. We packed it away among our various souvenirs. The biggest surprise was when I actually made tea out of this back home. This tea gave out a beautiful aroma akin to the GI coded Darjeeling, and can take a wee drop of milk. The colour is towards grey and not the gold associated with Darjeeling but that is the only variance. Excellent Himalayan tea, and I would recommend a \"must buy\" if you are a tea lover.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1973649-d4371713-r193023440-Ghorakhal_Tea_Factory-Bhowali_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Ghorakhal Tea Factory", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Organic small tea estate in Ghorakhal", "review": "This is a 100% organic tea estate run by uttarakhand govt.
