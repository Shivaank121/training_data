Perched atop the highest mountain in Bhimtal is Karkotaka which has a ancient temple devoted to Naga devta.  A fair(mela) is held atop Karkotaka Temple on Nag Panchmi. I climbed towards the Karkotaka temple from the Bhimtal -Naukuchiatal road a little before the diversion to Jangaliagaon.  The climb is tough and arduous through winding tracks which gradually take you upwards.   The path is mostly barren but as you reach the top just before the final climb there is patch of green trees and if your throat is parched you can gulp mouthful of water from an ancient water source.   This patch of green is clearly visible if you look at the Karkotaka temple from the Bhimtal-Haldwani road.  My uncle who used to live in Bhimtal told me that there is a folklore about a subterranean lake inside the mountain.  Once you make the final climb to Karkotaka from the green patch you would find that the ancient temple is an assemblage of rounded rocks. The view from atop is incomparable and majestic as offers a 360 degree view of all the places around.  It took me nearly four hours to climb up and down the mountain.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g679051-d4089009-r282625656-Karkotaka_Temple-Bhimtal_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Karkotaka Temple", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Nag Temple", "review": "The temple is named after snake cobra and at the height of 600 ft at the Karkotaka  hills. visited and worshiped by thousands of people over the year.
