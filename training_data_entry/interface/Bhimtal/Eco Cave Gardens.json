Once you are inside, it is nice. But it will be difficult for old people and big sized people. There are 6 caves, we only went to the first one. It's only the experience of walking inside the cave and the cool ambiance, there is nothing more to it.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g660548-d3187611-r131802253-Eco_Cave_Gardens-Nainital_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Eco Cave Gardens", "rating": 3.0, "title": "For kids", "review": "Good for kids ! Quite possible that you go into the cave and come out hurt, so better watch the height.
