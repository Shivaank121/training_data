The place is clean and quiet; far better than nainital and other main stream destinations. The lake itself is beautiful and you would get boating options. The good part Is that you can go for boating even if it is raining s all the boats (peddling and shikaras) come with a roof. We visited in Aug end so obviously we were surrounded by clouds and accompanied with rains. It was fun to boat in such a lovely weather. You would find some good accommodation options \u2013 Lake resort (expensive), Aadrika (best in terms of value for money) and some decent cafes. You can simply walk alongside the lake and enjoy the weather. I would suggest to pick a room with full view of the lake so you may enjoy sunrise/sunset accordingly.
