You have to climb/ walk steep road to get to the Zoo gate and ticket office. The entrance fee is 100 rupees per person. Then again there is steep climbs and stairs to see each animal. The collection of animals is very ordinary and nothing to write home about. Most kids and elderly can hardly make few steps inside the gate before they are exhausted.

The   vehicle will leave you at the entrance of the zoo, but reaching inside the zoo is really tiresome due to steep road and distance from the stoppage. Not suggested for the old people unless they have some special arrangements for them. But while walking through the steep road one can have the panoramic view of the Nainital town which is really awesome and unforgettable and it will take away all your fatigue. This is the only attraction one can have while visiting the zoo. otherwise inside the zoo you become so tired that you will prefer to sit in benches and admire the beauty of the nature from the hill top.
