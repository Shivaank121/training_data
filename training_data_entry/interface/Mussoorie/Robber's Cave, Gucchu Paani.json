Robber's cave or local name Guchchu paani is small hill way between two very close hills. Water flows from one cave which is around 200 meters inside from the opening of both the hills. Its nice experience to walk against water flow towards the cave. Feeling of cold water to feet is excellent and cannot be forgot. Water is very clean and its level is just to immerse the feet inside water. Its different than to walk in sea shore as the sea water is warmer always. Hills around add excitement in journey. Main cave is having fast water flow coming out and hence we avoided to go nearer. small snacks restaurant is available in opening where you can experience hot tea with feet immersed in cold water. It is different experience and worth watch. Local people say that robbers used to hide here due to difficult terrain.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g15338783-d3385192-r136719907-Robber_s_Cave_Gucchu_Paani-Malsi_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Robber's Cave, Gucchu Paani", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Experiance", "review": "Even though People go there for fun, a walk in cave. filled with fresh spring water and exciting Place.
