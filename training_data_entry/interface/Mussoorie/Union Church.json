For this reason I like old unaltered temples or churches. This church indeed has a traditional basic style of architecture. It was coloured in a pattern which was new to me. I believe that it was not in original plan but coloured in this way some years ago. Maybe some other Mussoorie buildings have also been coloured in similar fashion. Electrical poles, wires, banners, trees etc have obscured views of all good buildings of Mussoorie and same was the case here. However, I managed to get some good pictures from roof of my hotel since it was close to Church.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d10279426-r517458549-Union_Church-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}]
