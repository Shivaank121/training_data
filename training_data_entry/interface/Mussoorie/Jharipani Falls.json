Instead he took us to Musssourie Lake - very ordinary. We insisted that this is not where we wanted to go, but he insisted that there was nothing to see in the Falls. Somehow we convinced him to take us there. We could hear the water from far, but it came upon us suddenly - unspoiled. There were just a few youngsters there and a couple sitting on a rock. Up above, we spotted an eating joint. The water rushing down in a foam was well worth the visit.
