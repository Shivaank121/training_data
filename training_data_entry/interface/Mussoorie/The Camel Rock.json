We visited the place in the evening and it was little dark but we could manage to see the Camel Rock. Camel back  road is normally used by the local people for morning and evening walk. One can reach to the camel back road through Mall road. There is one road which goes up from mall road near rope way station to Cambridge book Depot and the road which is adjacent to Cambridge book depot, goes down to Camel back road. I would recommend this place to visit.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d12498932-r574764700-The_Camel_Rock-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "The Camel Rock", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice Views of mountains ", "review": "Camel rock not clearly visible from telescope.
