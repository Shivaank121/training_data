It is the second highest peak after Lal Tibba. Gun Hill is situated at an altitude of 6640 feet approximately. One can reach to the Gun Hill easily by boarding cable car from the cable car station (popularly known as Jhula Ghar) which is situated at Mall Road approximately 500 meters from Library Chowk. It is said that a gun was installed there during the colonial rule which was fired at mid day to facilitate citizens to adjust their watches. It was really enjoyable to reach to the Gun Hill by Trolley. View from the trolley was beautiful. There are many restaurants, Game shops etc. at Gun Points but these shops are really hindering the 360 degree views. However whatever views from the Gun hill can be seen are really amazing. Paid Binoculars are also installed at Gun Hill, one can see the far situated points such as Lal Tibba, Nag Devta Temple etc. from there with the help of Binoculars. Panoramic view of Garhwal & Shivalik Ranges of Himalaya were mesmerizing. It was really chilly there in the evening, one must carry the woolens while visiting Gun Hill.

The location is pretty good but totally infested with shops which ultimately blocks the view to natural landscapes from such an altitude.
