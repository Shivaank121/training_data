It could even be called local museum. You should really have to visit it to get some insight into the local Himalayan culture. It shows you a collection of local art, paintings with Himalayan motives, handicraft, musical instrumentes throughout the history, and there is even a temple, which the couple built by their own. All is made by a couple, with a lot of commitment...So really a must.
