I liked some of the exhibits and the idea that someone has tried to reproduce the feel of Raj times. I liked the idea of putting pictures of John Gould's paintings and sketches and paintings used in T.C. Jerdon's book. We bought T-shirts with Jabarkhet printed on them, a book and a few more things. We failed to meet owner and were entertained by a young girl. While writing the review I read comment of someone who has mentioned that this center is located in Pahari Wilson;s house. Well, if it comes to buildings, I have noticed a lot of buildings that have a character and would like to know who owned them in Raj times and what use they were of in olden times.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d7160849-r517453234-Mussoorie_Heritage_Centre-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Mussoorie Heritage Centre", "rating": 4.0, "title": "historic", "review": "Every state must have one of its own heritage centre to preserve the tradition and artifacts of the locality besides holding important functions", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d7160849-r575446601-Mussoorie_Heritage_Centre-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Mussoorie Heritage Centre", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Old building", "review": "This building is very old near clock tower in Landour marking.
