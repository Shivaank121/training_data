We had to pay Rs.40/- on the way as charges to visit the waterfall. Parking charges were Rs.100/-. There are local food joints around the place and one has to descend about 200 staircases to reach the main waterfall. There are shops around the staircases. The prices are inflated for almost everything, as expected. Upon reaching the falls we discovered, it was more like a swimming pool with waterfall overhead. There are shops around the pool selling snacks and offering clothes on rent for taking a dip into the pool. We were not at all impressed and felt the place is overhyped. We took a dip and spent hardly 45 minutes after paying Rs.140/- for almost nothing and driving up and down for around one hour. One can use the cable car to ascend and descend to the waterfall, if walking down the stairs is difficult. Cable car charges Rs.120/- for both ways and Rs.100/- for one way.
