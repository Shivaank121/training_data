There are 2 cafe there offering binoculars to view the Himalayas. We went to one of those (right next to Nahata Estates). They charge Rs.50 per person to go upstairs and use binoculars or order something from their cafe. I would recommend order something and enjoy it on the terrace with beautiful view.

After another 15 mins walk, you reach Doma's Inn. Its a Tibetan style, beautiful restaurant. They rent bikes and Scooty as well. Its very close to Ruskin Bond's home. On the way you go through old Mussoorie, Landhaur Bazar. Your next stop is Char Dokan. Form Doma's Inn to Char Dokan, it takes from half an hour to 45 minutes depending upon your physical strength, as its a steep hike. Char Dokan is a very delicious place. I am saying this because you can have many delicious items here. We tried aloo parantha, pan cake and shakes at the first shop while going. Then your last stop is Lal Tibba. From Char Dokan to Lal Tibba, its an easy beautiful romantic walk through woods. Lal Tibba is the highest point in Mussoorie. There is a view point with  binoculars. If you are lucky enough and the sky is clear, you might see snow covered Himalayan range from there. Try chocolate shake at view point.
