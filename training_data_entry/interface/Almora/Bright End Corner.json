As time grows by the colours of the various objects around the area keeps changing and the views getting better and better. The first splash of the sun started falling on a highest mountain viewed from a very far distance and then the rays started spreading into the other hills and to the full of the valley itself. There were few people doing meditation over there. The taxi driver told that the Himalayan mountain range visible from there is Nilkantha mountain range and I am not sure about this since I have never been to Nilkantha mountain range so far. There is a caf\u00e9 located near this area and you can enjoy having slight refreshment here over the sun which has initiated the refreshment anyway.
