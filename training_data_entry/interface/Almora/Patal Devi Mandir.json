At one place one has to go between two rocks; NOT recommended for old, infirm and fat persons. It is such relief to reach floor of the cave! The sights inside the cave make one forget the trouble of reaching there. The Jata of Shiv in white, hanging from the roof of the cave is absolutely breath-taking; as also the thousand feet of Airawatha elephant.As the air circulation inside is insufficient for a large number of people, at a given time, only a few persons are taken inside.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g679053-d6496178-r238401849-Patal_Devi_Mandir-Almora_Almora_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Patal Devi Mandir", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Do not miss this", "review": "A place you would never know existed, a mandatory must visit", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g679053-d6496178-r207092199-Patal_Devi_Mandir-Almora_Almora_District_Uttarakhand.html"}]
