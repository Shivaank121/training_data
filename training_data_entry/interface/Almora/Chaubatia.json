Without the guide you will not be able to understand anything. He will tell you so many interesting things which you will miss if you don't hire him. You should be wearing comfortable clothing and shoes for going inside as you need to walk a lot that too on down slopes , steps . Its  like trekking inside.

Don't hire the guides. They're not worth it. They just point out the flowers and trees. Unless you're really into botany, do the hike by yourself.

The department has opened a cafeteria which sells natural products like various juices including that of Rhododendron. Make sure you are purchasing the right quality from there. Government has outsourced that is fine but cannot allow selling of poor quality products to the tourists. Although all products are with FSSAI certified labels but when used you can make out the difference. The department has 12 guides who usually wait at the entrance gate and charge you INR 300/- for garden visit and INR 600/- for deep forest visit. But you don't get any receipts. They also lure the tourists in the pretext of selling essences of pine, nilgiri and eucalyptus. Not sure whether this is allowed by Government tourist guides. Ideally there should be outlets with good quality products for such items. The deep forest visit is worth of one hour to know about medicinal values of trees, herbs and shrubs.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g679030-d2721882-r652721908-Chaubatia-Ranikhet_Almora_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Chaubatia", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Little trek in the gardens and forest of chaubatia.", "review": "We took the garden tour with services of guide Mr. Deepak Bisth.
