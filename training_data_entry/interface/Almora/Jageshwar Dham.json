But it was completely opposite, Jageshwar is the most beautiful temple complex I have ever seen in my life. It is not a temple. It is a complex of more than a hundred Jyotirlingas or Shiva's phallic representation. Built in the ancient era it has interesting things to see such as the little hut like temples and beautiful Deodar trees. The best sight to see here is the tree that bifurcates from the same root. It has the significance that these two trees represent Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. It also has an inflow of the river Ganga or called Jata Ganga as it is the river flowing through the hair of Lord Shiva. It also has the \"Hawankund\" where Luv-Kush and Ravana worshiped the fire-god. The experience is mystical with clouds and it is isolated from the rest of Almora and Binsar.
