The second reason for me that Mehtab Bagh was an excellent visit was an archeological excavation pit along what was a wall of the earlier site.  It went down probably about 20-25 feet to the top of an arch.  That leads me to believe that the wall went a good ways below the 20-25 feet, and increases my curiosity of what is below the other structures visible at the site.  I don\u2019t know how long ago the pit was dug, but it looks like it was quite a while ago.  Now-a-days there is a flock of very pretty birds that live in the pit.

Even without the colour effects the sunset visit is an opportunity for one last look at this gorgeous building. Locals in the area will offer to have their photos taken and then ask for a donation. Have the good grace not to take the photo if you are not going to pay - these people probably earn less per month then we spend on a single meal. If you take their photo, pay up ok.

However, it wasn\u2019t crowded at all when we were there and had nice views of the Taj Mahal across the river. The pollution was terrible, so the views were very hazy. Still, probably worth the small admission fee to be able to see it with few people in your way.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2018915-r659998900-Mehtab_Bagh-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Mehtab Bagh", "rating": 4.0, "title": "An alternative place to enjoy Taj Mahal", "review": "is an alternative place to enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal from the other side.

It is not really a garden yet, as nothing is rally established yet. There is a fee of IR300 to enter, which is a rip-off.Although it was raining when we were there we had a very good view of the Taj.

I think Mehtab Bagh was a field before without the admission fee. But when we came, we were asked to pay Rs 300 just because the place got a nice view of Taj Mahal. Also, it was still undeveloped yet so it was so dusty. We can see the Taj Mahal alright, and even took some pictures. But, I think it was too overpriced.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2018915-r661280833-Mehtab_Bagh-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Mehtab Bagh", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Not as Good as Expected", "review": "We were told there were beautiful gardens and you got fantastic sunset views of the Taj Mahal. The gardens were mainly rose gardens that were without a single flower. There were a few flower beds with flowers but most were empty. Unfortunately it was overcast and we didn't even get a sunset! You do get some beautiful views of the backside of the Taj Mahal. Perhaps in a different season, with roses blooming, and on a clear day, this would be a far better experience. I would not consider this a must see if I had only limited time.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2018915-r661417045-Mehtab_Bagh-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}]
