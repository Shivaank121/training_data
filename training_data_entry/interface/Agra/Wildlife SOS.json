The staff who took us on the guided tours were friendly and very knowledgeable. It is clear that the animals are very well cared for and, whilst their past stories are sad, it's great to see that they are now living somewhere that meets their needs. If you would like to have a more up close experience with wildlife in India and want to avoid supporting activities that exploit animals then I would 100% recommend a visit to Wildlife SOS.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2048779-r654610318-Wildlife_SOS-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Wildlife SOS", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Majestic- Tales of Love & Rescue", "review": "I recently visited the elephant rescue with my sister.

Can highly recommend", "review": "We visited both the SOS bears and Elephant centre (10 minutes drive apart). The work that they do is incredible and we now donate on a monthly basis. Each tour was very informative. My daughter is considering going back to volunteer for a few weeks. I'm hoping that more tourists become aware of these fantastic sancturies. Keep up the exceptional work guys!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2048779-r657754644-Wildlife_SOS-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Wildlife SOS", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Highly recommend stopping by!", "review": "This is a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours and break up the car journey from Delhi to Agra or vice versa. Book your slot in advance via the website, we were late as we got stuck in Delhi traffic... the charity does amazing work not only in rescuing traumatised and injured bears from their lives as so-called dancing bears but also supports the communities that maintained these traditions by encouraging them into different work or even working for the charity itself. They rescue elephants and snakes too! You pay an entrance fee and a suggested donation, or can also buy a specific gift such as sponsoring a bear or paying for food for a month or medical care... keep up the good work!
