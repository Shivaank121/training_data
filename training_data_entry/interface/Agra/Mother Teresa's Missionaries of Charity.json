Yes, by all means go see the Taj Mahal - it is a wondrous building with incredible detail, but please leave a little time to visit Sister Glory and the Missionaries of Charity and donate anything you can (they rely soley on donations for everything).  They are always in need of basic medial supplies such as sticking plasters, latex gloves,  syringes, antibiotics as well as multi-vitamins.  For the school age children (and some of the adults), exercise books/paper/pens/pencils etc.  Clothing for adults, children and babies is always welcome.  Even if you can't squeeze any of these or similar items into your luggage, then take along some sweets/candy and go witness the love and care these wonderful missionaries offer to men, women and children who have been cast aside by society.
