One hears the same complaints at the zoo from visitors all the time..can you wake them up?..can they come closer?.. This is a rescue and these animals benefit greatly from your support of this facility. You might see a sleeping bear, or a resting bear from 20-40 feet away. But you visit a place like this not to get a great photo of  a bear but rather to educate yourself that we as mankind once did a cruel thing, but now are making it right. Which is a good feeling. You can read many educational signs and watch a movie and visit a nice little gift shop. And you WILL see sloth bears, as seeing them in the wild in the parks is hard to do.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d4088755-r539948294-Sur_Sarovar_Bird_Sanctuary-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary", "rating": 2.0, "title": "Waste of time but a good cause for bears", "review": "As an animal friend it's great that India has banned Dancing Bears.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d4088755-r454429759-Sur_Sarovar_Bird_Sanctuary-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Bird Sanctuary", "review": "Sur Sarovar is a good place to visit.

The authorities here should make adequate arrangements for crowd situation. We took cycle rickshaw to wander inside. The proper jeeps were not plying.
