This tomb was built on the orders of Muslim Emperor Jahangir's wife Noorjahan for his father Mirza Ghiyas. The walls are made up of White Marble and embedded with semi precious stones. This place is less crowded then Taj Mahal and it is good idea to spend time here.This is one of very cute and small place in Agra . You would be finding some rich art work there . Was built before then Taj Mahal an inspiring place for Taj Mahal also . Must visit if you have even little bit interest in Art work & history .
