Then Brahma and Vishnu were competing with each other and to determine who is superior told each other whoever sees the end of the Linga is the more powerful. Vishnu went downward and Brahma upward and both could not find the end. But Brahma found a flower called Thazham pu and asked where she was coming from. The pride filled flower said from the TOP of the Shiva Linga. Brahma thought he could claim he saw the TOP end of the Linga and use the flower as witness. He did so and told Vishnu that he had seen the TOP and that he is more powerful hence. Knowing this Lord Shiva got angry and cursed that there won't be any temple for Brahma and thazhampu will not be used for worship. Only four Temples thus were left for worship of Brahma.
