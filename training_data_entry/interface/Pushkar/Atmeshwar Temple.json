Not better and mostly not worse than other temples in Pushkar. But its  bad location is bad for its fame. Although it stands very close to the main market road. As soon as you pass the mosque, you should turn not to the left, where you lead the way to Brahma temple, but to the right and after about 60 meters turn left. Or the second option \u2013 to find the \"Diamond hotel\" (I stayed there), go straight along this street without turning anywhere. There will still be something like a small garden.
