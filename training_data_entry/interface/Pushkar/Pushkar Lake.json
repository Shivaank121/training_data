India is full of scams and 'tricks'.  If someone wants your attention - \"Just keep walking\", say nothing - and do not give any indication of engaging in any sort of conversation.  After 3 months of solid travel in India, my sunglasses, earphones and the 'I'm ignoring you' type attitude worked wonders, especially as a solo female traveller.  Save your energy, don't respond, don't engage with anyone (most young males wanting your attention) and keep walking - they give up pretty promptly. Do visit the Lake at sunset and just keep to yourself.  Any engagement of any sort of conversation with anyone is likely heading for some kind of trouble i.e. extracting money from your pockets.

The whole exercise did not seem very priestly but focused on getting donations in a high pressure manner. The prayer was short and the conversation quickly centered on extracting donations.
