As much as I hate to say it, we loved the little town of Pushkar and the people that ran our hotel.....as well as the views of the lake at day or night.  Although we were fortunate enough to see one very beautiful and moving Hindu ceremony, we would not visit again during the Pushkar Camel Festival (there really are no camels).  People were arriving at the lake at 3:45 in the morning and the noise was overbearing by 4:30 AM. Lots of scam artists and beggars. The crowds, smells, and relentless noise just wasnt worth it to us.

Hundreds of camels, dust, noise, market stalls, hordes of people, including very poor looking families in makeshift camps everywhere, touts flogging all sorts of merchandise, beggars including what looked to be Hindu priests and camel cart rides. It is obviously a major trading event for camel and horse owners and a significant cultural experience for tourists who flock here for this event.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319729-d10020421-r644448930-Pushkar_Camel_Fair-Pushkar_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Pushkar Camel Fair", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Bustling camel and horse trading fair", "review": "Our first visit here and we saw hundreds of camels and horses for trade; by small time traders all over india. I believe this fair has become smaller over time. However, it is still interesting to see the many camels, how they are cared for, and visiting the families that make tented homes here for the fair. Small tents with outdoor makeshift kitchens. Groups of men and women gather togethers squatting in small groups to while away the time, Also lots of small shops selling camel and horse paraphernalia, together with small shack restaurant, household good and clothing shops and fruit/vegetable stalls. Lots of active and vibrant life here.  But be prepared for the noise, dust, dirt and lack of toilet facilities.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319729-d10020421-r645595709-Pushkar_Camel_Fair-Pushkar_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Pushkar Camel Fair", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Pushkar Camel Fare", "review": "The Pushkar Camel Fair is much more than just a Camel Fair it is an incredible Fair with event that also include the visiting Foreigners like the  Indians vs Foreigners Tug of War, and the Foreigners Bride and Groom Contest, Indians vs Foreigners Cricket Match, as well as much more. This is a Fair like Non Other, this is a Fair where everyone is apart of the great stage. Oh Yes and 30,000 Camales with 10,000 Desert Peoples and their families that have come from great distances to be here. I highly recommend the Pushkar Camel Fair.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319729-d10020421-r645749122-Pushkar_Camel_Fair-Pushkar_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Pushkar Camel Fair", "rating": 4.0, "title": "A highlight of our trip", "review": "Unknown to us at the time of booking our tour, the Pushkar Camel Fair just happened to be on as we were travelling through the area on our way to Ajmer.  We have stayed in Pushkar on a previous trip, but had missed the Fair by one week, so we asked our driver/ guide to stop for a few hours so we could have a look and we were very glad we did.  It was a morning visit, but there were still lots happening.  Camel rides, entertainment, horses for sale, lots of rides, stalls selling clothes, household items, souvenirs and various other wares, food vendors etc.  Lots of colour, lots of noise, but all very exciting.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319729-d10020421-r646461867-Pushkar_Camel_Fair-Pushkar_Ajmer_District_Rajasthan.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Pushkar Camel Fair", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Camel fair rink", "review": "Central location from the lake.
