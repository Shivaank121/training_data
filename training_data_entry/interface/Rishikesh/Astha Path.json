It's a nice place to walk around and enjoy Ganga veiw, but it's not maintained well, it was very dirty, didn't feel safe either. We stayed for about ten mins and left. If it's paid attention to,this place can turn into a nice tourist hub. They should add more benches, have some kind of security", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g580106-d14063768-r584295573-Astha_Path-Rishikesh_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Astha Path", "rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful", "review": "This is a beautiful place.
