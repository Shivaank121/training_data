The actual Aarti doesn't start until about 7:30, but there is a whole programme if havan, chantings, bhajans prior to it which lead to the aarti. Good time to reach would be around 5:30 and take a place from where the central stairs are clearly visible. Usually there is a huge crowd of visitors wanting to witness the event so the earlier you reach the better else you will get a place to stand at quite some distance from where you will not be able to see much.
