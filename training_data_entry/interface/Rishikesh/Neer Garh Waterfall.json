It took us 2 hours to walk from Lakshman Jhula to reach the base of the waterfall. We walked along the winding road, which sometimes seemed a little dangerous when many cars were driving by. If you do not want to walk, there are a few buses and taxis that will take you to the base point. The climb from the base is more tedious and can take up to an hour. There are 3 main points of the waterfall till the top. The waterfall is pretty secluded, with only a few tourists around. In the summer months, having a bath there and picnic later would be fun. There is a small food stall, which sells hot maggi noodles and tea. I would recommend Neer Garh to people who would want to go for a nearby easy trek.

Took a short cut after a kilometre following the advice of a tea stall owner. The short cut takes you to one of the lower falls. No people around.
