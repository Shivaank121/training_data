In the present day scenario, the Lakshman Jhula is visited by thousands of tourists each year not just because of its ancient origins and religious sanctity, but also due to the recent developments that have taken place around the bridge.

It's more or less a footbridge with the occasional scooter and motorbikes, and has its own mad bustling charm, including a subtle but noticeable under-sway. The bridge links Tapovan with the east bank and the ancient Trayambakeshwar temple, and changes mood multiple times a day. In the early mornings, you can stride across, along with a few tinkling donkeys, but at other times you'll find yourself inching your way through the hoards; families taking selfies, mischievous monkeys, locals and Western backpackers. Crossing at peak times is a meditation in agility and patience! I recommend you place yourself directly behind a scooter and try to keep up, so you can use it's 'wake' to cut through the crowds. The view of the Ganges, if you are able to pause for a few moments, is lovely, and the river's breeze can be a welcome respite from the heat.
