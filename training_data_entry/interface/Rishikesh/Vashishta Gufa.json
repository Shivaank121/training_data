The cave itself is not beautiful. It is located next to a Ganges beach. The cave is used for meditation. It's a dark small cave with thin cushions and you can sit down for a (short) meditation. You feel a special energy (spiritual or not). The entrance is free. And you can reach the cave after a 100 meter walk down (stairs). You can also visit the nearby beach.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g580106-d4092570-r620001761-Vashishta_Gufa-Rishikesh_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Vashishta Gufa", "rating": 4.0, "title": "Meditative location", "review": "The time we went (just about closing time at 6 AM), there were not many people to guide and inform what exactly was there to see here.
