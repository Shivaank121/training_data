The Arathi takes places near Triveni Ghat and it is better to be seated at around 5.45 PM for this.  The pandits, facing the river, Ma Ganga pray to the river considering her as a form of the Divine. Seating is comfortable on steps that have been built for the purpose.  With as many as a dozen pandits standing on elevated platforms facing the river perform the pooja and the dusk sets it, it is an experience that cannot be explained in words.
