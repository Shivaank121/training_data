However, the place is best avoided if you have lots of small kids as the artifacts on display are irreplaceable if damaged. Take your time reading the descriptions. My teenage son was disappointed to find several descriptions of guns on display missing. The descriptions of weapons can be expanded beyond their names to include information on their range, accuracy and firing mechanism etc. Overall it was a very informative visit. The Garhwal Rifles parade ground is right adjacent to the museum. So, if you visit between 4:00 to 5:30 in the evening, there is a good chance of you finding soldiers practicing their marching skills with an army band playing along.
