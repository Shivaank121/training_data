After passing beyond the Tip in Top point we have to proceed ahead on the road for around one kilometer when a signboard for the Santoshi Mata Mandir can be seen on the right side . Park your vehicle by the roadside, where plenty of space is available, and a steep climb on the right side takes you to the temple on foot. The temple is at a spot higher than the Tip in Top point, however the views are not that good. The temple has a boundary wall all-around and is gated. It is a small temple maintained by the Garwhal Rifles people and is quite clean . No shop exists for selling Prasad etc. No pandit can be found inside. If we visit the Tip in Top point than we must not give this temple a miss.
