It is a point from where you can view mountain ranges. We went there in the month of August and were very lucky to be able to view the beauty of rain washed lush green valley as well as mountain ranges covered with thin clouds. The scenery cannot be described in words and one has to experience it!! I could not stop clicking the various moods of the mother nature as it changed from little sunny to misty cool to a view where you see only some part of the ranges bathed in bright Sun while the rest coverd with thick cover of clouds time just flies here and you still do not have enough of it!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1208973-d2693616-r138530044-Tip_in_Top_Point-Lansdowne_Pauri_Garhwal_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Tip-in-Top Point", "rating": 2.0, "title": "Gross disappointment.", "review": "Nature at its best but despite God being so kind to this place man has kept it in shambles.
