The charges are Rs.50 per adult and 30 for children as you enter into the zoo there are different types of birds and then little bit away from there you can see the tiger which is the main attraction i would say as i have seen lot of people stood almost 30 mins watching the tiger and did i tell you it is actually quite spectacular when it comes close to you and stops infront of you for a second and after that little bit further you can find leopard and himalayan beer which is quite lazy and the you will be greeted by deer and 2 more leopards on top of hill and on way back you find more birds like owl, hawk, eagle, vulture, monkeys, parrots, peacocks, sambar, wolf and Red panda there are 4 to 5 of them which are very cute. I would advise you to spend good 40 to 50 mins in the zoo and you can have a beautiful sunset view from the entrance of the zoo, and yeah the zoo closes by 5pm.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g660548-d2556333-r449771494-High_Altitude_Zoo-Nainital_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "High Altitude Zoo", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Can be improved", "review": "Very few animals in the zoo.
