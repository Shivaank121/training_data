It is a quiet place in the midst of dense forest and lovely birds migrate here. You will enjoy the solitude and calmness of the place with occassional chirps from the forest. Nice place but advisable if you are travelling in a group. Also dont go late as it becomes lonely and dark after 3pm.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g660548-d4088747-r221966882-Pangot_and_Kilbury_Bird_Sanctuary-Nainital_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}, {"point_of_interest": "Pangot and Kilbury Bird Sanctuary", "rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice place but read my feedback", "review": "If you choose to go to this place for bird watching, you have to make it at the very early morning. Challenge is during winters the sun rises not before 7 am and by that time you complete your breakfast and start from your hotel its late for bird watching. May be you can stay for a night in the Pangot area (The Nest is what we could see as an option).", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g660548-d4088747-r190559655-Pangot_and_Kilbury_Bird_Sanctuary-Nainital_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html"}]
