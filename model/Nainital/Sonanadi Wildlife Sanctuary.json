On road it can be reached straight via Kotdwar , Lansdown , Sendhikhal (take diversion at bridge on left) to Vatan Vasa. You do not get a 4WD here easily and should be hired from Sendhikhal . 2WD is a risky on hilly terrain. Wonderful place for nature lover and remember at FRH power is a scanty and it is absolute dark after 8 pm till 6 am. I was there with my wife & son and enjoyed the entire stay. Deers, rein deers, elephants, birds are common. Tiger sighting a luck and we could only realize that one had followed us while getting back from river side.
