Very well maintained and a must visit. A little story that most Cabbies enroute will tell yo uis that This place, along with two others ahead all have scary names. Kainchi(scissor)dham, followed by garampani (hot water) followed by khairna (won't be spared) ! All said..  a lovely calm temple which on a usual day is extremely peaceful, not many visitors and has a gorgeous view of the surroundings.
