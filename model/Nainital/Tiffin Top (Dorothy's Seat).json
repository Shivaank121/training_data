Mean while mid-way you get a chance to enjoy Zipliner. Don't go for it it waste of money or negotiate heavily. Because zipline is very short (150 mts). Still if you want to try it as experience then do it but negotiate heavily. They ask 250-300 but dosen't felt it should cost more than 100. For Zipliner go to Neemrana Rajasthan.
